## Getting Started
### How to Run the Application
1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the FastAPI application:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

4. Open the API documentation in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

5. Test the API endpoints using the interactive documentation.
- **/create-profile:** Upload an image to create a detailed profile. The response will include demographics, facial expressions, and facial analysis results.
- **/verify-images:** Upload two images to verify if they are of the same person. The response will include a verification result. 


## Libraries and Frameworks
### Pydantic
**Reason for Choosing:**
- Pydantic is used for data validation and serialization. It ensures the API requests and responses adhere to the defined schema, enhancing data integrity and security.

### NumPy
**Reason for Choosing:**
- NumPy is used for handling image data as arrays. It is efficient for numerical computations and is well-integrated with other scientific libraries.

### DeepFace
DeepFace is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis (age, gender, emotion and race) framework for python. It is a hybrid face recognition framework wrapping state-of-the-art models: VGG-Face, FaceNet, OpenFace, DeepFace, DeepID, ArcFace, Dlib, SFace and GhostFaceNet. 

**Reason for Choosing:**

- I chose DeepFace for its simplicity and ease of use. It is a high-level API that abstracts the complexities of the underlying models. 

- Fun fact: DeepFace has been downloaded over 2 million times on PyPI.

### ImageAnalyzer Class
The `ImageAnalyzer` class is used to encapsulate the facial analysis logic. This separation of concerns ensures that the API endpoints remain clean and focused on request handling.

### Profile Model
The `Profile` model is defined using Pydantic. This model includes detailed attributes such as demographics, facial expressions, and facial analysis. These attributes provide a comprehensive profile of a person's face.

### Endpoint Design
- **/create-profile:** Creates a detailed profile from an image. This endpoint is designed to handle image uploads, process the image using the `ImageAnalyzer` class, and return a structured profile.
- **/verify-target-image:** Verifies if the target image is of the same person as the reference image and is real. This endpoint is designed to handle two image uploads, process the images using the `ImageAnalyzer` class and the `DeepFace` recoginition model and return a verification result.

### Future Improvements
- **Multi-Face Detection:** Extend the application to detect and analyze multiple faces in an image. Currently, the application only analyzes the first face detected from the image. 

- **Feature Set** Include additional facial features or attributes that could further distinguish between real and fake images. We can consider adding features such as skin texture, background analysis, and facial hairs.

- **Performance Optimization:** Streamline the code and algorithms to reduce processing time and resource usage. This could involve optimizing the image processing pipeline, using more efficient data structures, or leveraging parallel processing techniques.

- **Diverse Demographics:** Ensure the system performs equally well access different age groups, genders and ethenicities to avoid bias. This could involve finetuning a pre-trained deepfake detection model on diverse datasets and evaluating its performance across different demographics.

- **Database Integration:** Store and retrieve profiles for future reference or analysis. This could involve using a vector database to store facial embeddings for faster retrieval.

- **Security Measures:** Consider adding features to protect user privacy when analyzing facial data. This could include data encryption, secure storage, and access control mechanisms.
